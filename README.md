# KYC Is Bad!

Over the past few years more than 600,000 people have had their personally identifying information leaked. This information was provided to companies for KYC/AML purposes, but was retained and mishandled leading to the KYC documents being exposed. 

**KYC documents may include the user's full names, home addresses, phone number, passport, photo, driving license, DOB, wallet addresses, balances, transactions, and IP address.**

Theese leaks put the users in danger and could face the threat of violence and robbery following these “doxing” events. Some victims have reported being threatened via phone and email.
